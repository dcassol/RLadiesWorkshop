# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header=TRUE)
inflammation <- read.csv("data/inflammation-01.csv", header=FALSE)

```

Subsetting your data is possibly the most common operation you will do, so it's worth taking some
more time to dive into this topic.  R has many powerful subset operators. Mastering them will allow 
you to easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three
different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with the workhorse of R: a simple numeric vector.  Let's make a vector from our data, by 
saving a column of inflammation data for a single day to a new variable. 

```{r}
day <- inflammation$V16
day
```

Okay, let's take a slice of this vector, so we have something smaller to work with.  And, we're going
to give our column 

```{r}
day <- day[1:5]
names(day) <- c('patient1', 'patient2', 'patient3', 'patient4', 'patient5')
day
```

> In R, simple vectors containing character strings, numbers, or logical values are called *atomic* 
vectors because they can't be further simplified.
{: .callout}

So now that we have a vector to play with, how do we get at its
contents?

## Accessing elements using their indices

As we've seen before, we can extract elements of a vector by using their corresponding index, 
starting from one.

```{r}
day[1]
```

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For vectors
(and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once:

```{r}
day[c(1, 3)]
```

Or slices of the vector:

```{r}
day[1:4]
```

We can ask for the same element multiple times:

```{r}
day[c(1,1,3)]
```

If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:
```{r}
day[6]
```

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

```{r}
day[0]
```

## Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:

```{r}
day[-2]
```

We can skip multiple elements:

```{r}
day[c(-1, -5)]  # or day[-c(1,5)]
```

> ## Tip: Order of operations

{: .callout}


To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back
into the variable:

```{r}
day <- day[-4]
day
```

{: .challenge}

## Subsetting by name

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index:

```{r}
# we can name a vector 'on the fly'
dailySamples <- c(sample1=5.4, sample2=6.2, sample3=7.1, sample4=4.8, sample5=7.5) 
dailySamples[c("sample1", "sample3")]
```

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the
position of various elements can often change when chaining together
subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

## Subsetting through other logical operations

We can also use any logical vector to subset:

```{r}
dailySamples[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

Since comparison operators (e.g. `>`, `<`, `==`) evaluate to logical vectors, we can also
use them to succinctly subset vectors: the following statement gives
the same result as the previous one.

```{r}
day[day > 7]
```

Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `day>7`, generating
a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, and then
selects the elements of `day` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name
(remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):

```{r}
day[names(day) == "patient1"]
```

>  * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right

>
> You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These two-character operators

>
>  * `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to
>    `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes

>    `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).

## Managing your environment

I think we might have a few things loaded in our environment.  Now is a good time to introduce
the `ls()` command. 

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r}
ls()
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!

```{r}
ls
```

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

## Skipping named elements

Skipping or removing named elements is a little harder. If we try to skip one named element by 
negating the string, R complains (slightly obscurely) that it doesn't know how to take the negative of a string:

```{r}
# we start again by naming a vector 'on the fly'
dailySamples <- c(sample1=5.4, sample2=6.2, sample3=7.1, sample4=4.8, sample5=7.5) 
dailySamples[-"sample1"]
```

However, we can use the `!=` (not-equals) operator to construct a logical vector that will do what we want:

```{r}
dailySamples[names(dailySamples) != "sample1"]
```

Skipping multiple named indices is a little bit harder still. Suppose we want to drop the 
`"sample1"` and `"sample3"` elements, so we try this:

```{r}
dailySamples[names(dailySamples)!=c("sample1","sample3")]
```

R did *something*, but it gave us a warning that we ought to pay attention to - and it apparently
*gave us the wrong answer* (the `"sample3"` element is still included in the vector)!

So what does `!=` actually do in this case? That's an excellent question.

### Recycling

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:

```{r}
names(dailySamples) != c("sample1", "sample3")
```

Why does R give `TRUE` as the third element of this vector, when `names(dailySamples)[3] != "sample3"` 
is obviously false?
When you use `!=`, R tries to compare each element
of the left argument with the corresponding element of its right
argument. What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?

![Inequality testing](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.1.png)

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

![Inequality testing: results of recycling](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.2.png)

In this case R **repeats** `c("sample1", "sample3")` as many times as necessary to match 
`names(dailySamples)`, i.e. we get `c("sample1","sample3","sample1","sample3","sample1")`. 
Since the recycled `"sample1"`
doesn't match the third element of `names(x)`, the value of `!=` is `TRUE`.
Because in this case the longer vector length (5) isn't a multiple of the shorter vector length (2), 
R printed a warning message. If we had been unlucky and `names(x)` had contained six elements, R would 
*silently* have done the wrong thing (i.e., not what we intended it to do). This recycling rule can 
can introduce hard-to-find and subtle bugs!

The way to get R to do what we really want (match *each* element of the left argument with *all* of 
the elements of the right argument) it to use the `%in%` operator. The `%in%` operator goes through 
each element of its left argument, in this case the names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur 
in the second argument?". Here, since we want to *exclude* values, we also need a `!` operator to 
change "in" to "not in":

```{r}
dailySamples[! names(dailySamples) %in% c("sample1","sample3") ]
```

## Handling special values

At some point you will encounter functions in R that cannot handle missing, infinite,
or undefined data.

There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA` (or `NaN`)
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

## Factor subsetting

Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how
do we subset the other data structures?

Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

```{r}
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
f[1:3]
```

Skipping elements will not remove the level
even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

```{r}
f[-3]
```

## Matrix subsetting

Matrices are also subsetted using the `[` function. In this case
it takes two arguments: the first applying to the rows, the second
to its columns:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(rnorm(6*4), ncol=4, nrow=6)
m[3:4, c(3,1)]
```

You can leave the first or second arguments blank to retrieve all the
rows or columns respectively:

```{r}
m[, c(3,4)]
```

If we only access one row or column, R will automatically convert the result
to a vector:

```{r}
m[3,]
```

If you want to keep the output as a matrix, you need to specify a *third* argument;
`drop = FALSE`:

```{r}
m[3, , drop=FALSE]
```

Unlike vectors, if we try to access a row or column outside of the matrix,
R will throw an error:

```{r, error=TRUE}
m[, c(3,6)]
```

> ## Tip: Higher dimensional arrays
>
> when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, each argument to `[`
> corresponds to a dimension. For example, a 3D array, the first three
> arguments correspond to the rows, columns, and depth dimension.
>
{: .callout}

Because matrices are vectors, we can
also subset using only one argument:

```{r}
m[5]
```


This usually isn't useful, and often confusing to read. However it is useful to note that matrices
are laid out in *column-major format* by default. That is the elements of the
vector are arranged column-wise:

```{r}
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
```

If you wish to populate the matrix by row, use `byrow=TRUE`:

```{r}
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

Matrices can also be subsetted using their rownames and column names
instead of their row and column indices.

## List subsetting

Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions
used to subset lists. We've already seen these when learning about atomic vectors and matrices:  `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

Using `[` will always return a list. If you want to *subset* a list, but not
*extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.

```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1]
```

This returns a *list with one element*.

We can subset elements of a list exactly the same way as atomic
vectors using `[`. Comparison operations however won't work as
they're not recursive, they will try to condition on the data structures
in each element of the list, not the individual elements within those
data structures.

```{r}
xlist[1:2]
```

To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square
bracket function: `[[`.

```{r}
xlist[[1]]
```

Notice that now the result is a vector, not a list.

You can't extract more than one element at once:

```{r, error=TRUE}
xlist[[1:2]]
```

Nor use it to skip elements:

```{r, error=TRUE}
xlist[[-1]]
```

But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:

```{r}
xlist[["a"]]
```

The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

```{r}
xlist$data
```
