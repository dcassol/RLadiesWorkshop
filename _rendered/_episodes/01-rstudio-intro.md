## Motivation

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and collected
data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start this process using
R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
how to plot results graphically. This example starts with a dataset from
[gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org) containing population information for many
countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the population for
Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on the continent of Asia?
By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations
for all of these countries in under a minute!

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

* [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Introduction to RStudio

Welcome to the R portion of the Software Carpentry workshop.

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of
the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for
scientific projects that will make your life easier.

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development
environment. It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.



**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 
> 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or 
> 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 
> 3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux 
> or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
> (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:


~~~
x <- 1/40
~~~
{: .language-r}

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:


~~~
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.025
~~~
{: .output}

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:


~~~
log(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -3.688879
~~~
{: .output}

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:


~~~
x <- 100
~~~
{: .language-r}

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:


~~~
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
~~~
{: .language-r}

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:


~~~
x = 1/40
~~~
{: .language-r}

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

## Comparing things **Dani: add this in the next section**

We can also do comparison in R:


~~~
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 < 2  # less than
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 > 0  # greater than
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Tip: Comparing Numbers
>
> A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should
> never use `==` to compare two numbers unless they are
> integers (a data type which can specifically represent
> only whole numbers).
>
> Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a
> certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look
> the same when printed out by R, may actually have
> different underlying representations and therefore be
> different by a small margin of error (called Machine
> numeric tolerance).
>
> Instead you should use the `all.equal` function.

## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):


~~~
ls()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "args"          "dest_md"       "missing_pkgs"  "required_pkgs"
[5] "src_rmd"       "x"             "y"            
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!


~~~
ls
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
function (name, pos = -1L, envir = as.environment(pos), all.names = FALSE, 
    pattern, sorted = TRUE) 
{
    if (!missing(name)) {
        pos <- tryCatch(name, error = function(e) e)
        if (inherits(pos, "error")) {
            name <- substitute(name)
            if (!is.character(name)) 
                name <- deparse(name)
            warning(gettextf("%s converted to character string", 
                sQuote(name)), domain = NA)
            pos <- name
        }
    }
    all.names <- .Internal(ls(envir, all.names, sorted))
    if (!missing(pattern)) {
        if ((ll <- length(grep("[", pattern, fixed = TRUE))) && 
            ll != length(grep("]", pattern, fixed = TRUE))) {
            if (pattern == "[") {
                pattern <- "\\["
                warning("replaced regular expression pattern '[' by  '\\\\['")
            }
            else if (length(grep("[^\\\\]\\[<-", pattern))) {
                pattern <- sub("\\[<-", "\\\\\\[<-", pattern)
                warning("replaced '[<-' by '\\\\[<-' in regular expression pattern")
            }
        }
        grep(pattern, all.names, value = TRUE)
    }
    else all.names
}
<bytecode: 0x555c1009c730>
<environment: namespace:base>
~~~
{: .output}

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:


~~~
rm(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:


~~~
rm(list = ls())
~~~
{: .language-r}

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:


~~~
rm(list <- ls())
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in rm(list <- ls()): ... must contain names or character strings
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors
>
> Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
> are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
> other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
> hasn't worked as expected.
>
> In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
> how to fix a problem.
>
{: .callout}

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

## Seeking Help

## Reading Help files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. The general syntax to search for help on any
function, "function_name", from a specific function that is in a package loaded into your
namespace (your interactive R session):


~~~
?function_name
help(function_name)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This will load up a help page in RStudio (or as plain text in R by itself).

Each help page is broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

Different functions might have different sections, but these are the main ones you should be aware of.

> ## Tip: Running Examples
>
> From within the function help page, you can highlight code in the 
> Examples and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to run it in 
> RStudio console. This is gives you a quick way to get a feel for
> how a function works.

> ## Tip: Reading help files
>
> One of the most daunting aspects of R is the large number of functions
> available. It would be prohibitive, if not impossible to remember the
> correct usage for every function you use. Luckily, the help files
> mean you don't have to!
{: .callout}

## Special Operators

To seek help on special operators, use quotes:


~~~
?"<-"
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Getting help on packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`.

## When you kind of remember the function

If you're not sure what package a function is in, or how it's specifically spelled you can do a fuzzy search:


~~~
??function_name
~~~
{: .language-r}

## When you have no idea where to begin

If you don't know what function or package you need to use
[CRAN Task Views](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/views)
is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into
fields. This can be a good starting point.

## When your code doesn't work: seeking help from your peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you are seeking have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag.

If you can't find the answer, there are a few useful functions to
help you ask a question from your peers:


~~~
?dput
~~~
{: .language-r}

Will dump the data you're working with into a format so that it can
be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session.


~~~
sessionInfo()
~~~
{: .language-r}
